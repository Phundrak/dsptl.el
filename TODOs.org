* TODO Create clickable links in plaintext files
With the use of a minor mode, create clickable links in plaintext
files. Some inspiration could come from ~org-ref~ which does something
similar with text in the form of ~cite:reference2020~.

It could also check whether the link is valid or not and apply a
different fontface in that case (again, like ~org-ref~ does).
