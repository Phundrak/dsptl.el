Dead Simple PlainText Links

~dsptl.el~ is born out of a university assignment where we were tasked
to create simple links between pages in the form of /Page A/ or /Page B/
being links to documents ~A~ or ~B~. The rest is history.

This README will become more fleshed out once this package reaches a
better working state.
